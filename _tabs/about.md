This is my personal blog.

I'm a software test engineer and open source developer from Boston, MA (USA). I
have over 25 years experience as a professional software engineer, and have
been involved in open source software as a maintainer and developer for over 2
decades. Most of my open source projects and contributions are related to
Python, Linux, test automation, and development tooling.

Currently, I am an active committer to the [Selenium project][selenium-home],
and maintainer of the Selenium [Python client bindings][selenium-python-docs].

You can connect with me on [LinkedIn][linkedin] or follow my work on
[GitHub][github-profile].
