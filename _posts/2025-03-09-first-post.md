Welcome to the new blog!

This is a space for my personal writing. I usually only write about technology.
The topics I mostly cover are:

- Programming
- Python
- Linux
- Open Source Software
- QA/Testing/Automation

Over the years, I've had a few different blogs. The last one, which I no
longer have access to update, is still
up at: [coreygoldberg.blogspot.com][blogger] (2008-2018). The rest are lost
to history (except for some stuff scattered across the Wayback Machine).
