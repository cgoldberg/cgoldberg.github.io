I just released a new version of the `xvfbwrapper` Python package to
[PyPI][pypi]. It's the first new release since 2016!

`xvfbwrapper` is a library for managing headless displays with Xvfb (X virtual
framebuffer) in Python. This new version includes bug fixes, and drops support
for Python 2.x.

You can install or upgrade with:

```console
pip install -U xvfbwrapper
```
