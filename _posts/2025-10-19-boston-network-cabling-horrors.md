I live in an old [brownstone](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownstone)
building in Boston that was contructed in the mid 1800's. Brownstone homes were
common in urban areas of the United States during the 19th-century in places
like New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. My neighborhood
([Back Bay](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_Bay,_Boston)) is almost entirely
comprised of these building. They were originally single-family townhouses for
the very wealthy residents of Boston, but are now carved up into multiple
condos and apartments (my building has 16 units).

These are beatiful historic buildings, but they were built before the invention
of the telephone... so obviusly there was no consideration for how to handle
modern telco infrastructure. However, we still need our internet access! Unlike
modern homes that hide network cables neatly inside their walls, we have
nowhere to discretelly put them. The wires come in from under the street into
a utility room, and are just run to every unit along the outside of the
building. This leads to some pretty hilarious cabling jobs when the network
technicians from various cable and internet providers come by to hook something
up.

This next picture shows the the box where the different units are split from
the the main lines. This picture was taken AFTER one technician reorganized the
cables. Before that, there  was a large nest about 3 feet in diameter that
included several garbage bags?:

From there, they are snaked along the outside walls to each unit:

(notice the brick facade covering the original brownstone)

This one is my favorite. I guess the technician didn't see where the other
cables originated and needed a way to connect a unit from inside the the
utility room. He just drilled a hole through the door and ran a separate
cable up the wall to the 5th floor. He also didn't bother to fasten it to the
wall, so it just flaps in the wind and gets snagged every time someone opens
the door (thanks Xfinity!):

Even with all this nonsense, we still have pretty reliable Internet and TV
service in an old Victorian era building... so I can't complain.
