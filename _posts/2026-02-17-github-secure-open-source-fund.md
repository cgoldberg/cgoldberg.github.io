I participated in the latest round of
[GitHub Secure Open Source Fund](https://github.com/open-source/github-secure-open-source-fund)
as a maintainer for the [Selenium](https://selenium.dev) project along with
maintainers from 70 other prominent open source projects.

It was 3 weeks of pretty intense practical training for securing open source
projects and supply chains. I learned a lot and it was cool to collaborate with
100+ other open source hackers. It really opened my eyes to the scale of
security threats in the wild and the complexity of dealing with them.

Big thanks to the security team at [GitHub](https://github.com/) for providing
this training (and donating $10k to our project!)
